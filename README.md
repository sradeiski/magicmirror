Node/AngularJS-based RaspberryPi project inspired by this cool project: https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror. 

This project is currently under development. 

## in progress
* Implementing server-side 'calendar' module (with configurable ical url) which returns configurable event metadata sets. (Module responds with the ical file, at the moment.)

## next steps 
* Finish client-side news module.
* Finish client-side calendar module.
* Finish styling 
* Edit motivational lines to some that make sense. (Maybe there is a service out there?)
* Set up small sample mirror on my webspace to show the mirror in action. 
* Write documentation on how to configure the mirror.
* Integrate this: http://codepen.io/FWeinb/pen/oyACz
* Add second HTML page with ability to modify configuration easily and on-the-fly. 
* (Maybe in separate project) Add music player module for magic mirrors with speakers - including another (responsive design) HTML page for controlling music playback.
