Node/AngularJS-based RaspberryPi project inspired by this cool project: https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror. 

This project is in a very rudimentary stage. 

## Planned next steps 
* Implement 'calendar' module (extract data from ical). 
* Implement 'news' module (for tech news and world news). 
* Implement clock skin like this: http://www.qlocktwo.com
* Styling (css or less?) 
* Add second HTML page with ability to modify configuration easily. 
* (Maybe in separate project) Add music player module for magic mirrors with speakers - including another HTML page for controlling music playback. 
* (Maybe in seperate project) Create script to run a nodejs server to serve this website and start browser on RaspberryPi automatically.
