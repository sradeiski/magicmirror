A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/FWeinb/pen/oyACz.

 Just a little side project to recreate the QLOCKTWO. I had an old version using canvas and images but it was ugly. This is plain HTML, CSS and javascript. 
The aim of this rewrite was to create an interface for creating multiply languages. 

Added the option to change the color of the clock.
